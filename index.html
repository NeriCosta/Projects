                👨🏾‍💻 More about me
            </summary>
            <p>I currently live in Brazil, love technology and I'm studying systems
                development with the ultimate goal of developing games. I'm very
                communicative and love working as part of a team, solving problems and
                creating projects. I have a basic knowledge of English A1/A2, but I'm
                passionate about languages and cultures and I want to learn and improve
                more and more.</p>
            <p>⚡ I enjoy reading, whether it's a good book, manga, or comics and playing
                games! I believe that our personal interests contribute to a more refined
                perception of things and problem-solving. ^_^</p>
